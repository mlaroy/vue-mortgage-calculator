# Vue Mortgage Calculator

This project is just a proof-of-concept. I initially built a tool for a client project some years ago using jQuery, and I wanted to see if I could replicate it as a simple Vue app.



## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

npm run lint
```
